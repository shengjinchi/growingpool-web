The US Dollar maintained a constructive tone on Tuesday, extending its recent advance amid persistent risk-off sentiment. Trading was cautious as markets awaited the release of the latest FOMC meeting minutes, which are expected to provide critical insight into the Federal Reserve's future policy path. The EUR/USD pair remained under pressure, hovering near key technical support levels as the Greenback found broad-based strength.

All attention is now focused on the imminent US data, with the UK’s inflation figures also on the radar. These releases are poised to dictate near-term direction for major currency pairs, including GBP/USD. The market's cautious stance reflects the high stakes for exchange rate movements, with traders positioning for potential volatility stemming from these pivotal economic indicators.

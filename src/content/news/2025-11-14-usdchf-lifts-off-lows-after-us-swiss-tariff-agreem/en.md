The USD/CHF currency pair rebounded from multi-week lows on Friday, finding a floor after news of a US-Swiss tariff agreement helped stabilize market sentiment. The pair had earlier dropped to its weakest level since October 17th during the European trading session before staging a modest recovery.

This uptick in the exchange rate was driven by a wave of dollar buying, as the new trade deal alleviated immediate concerns over potential transatlantic trade tensions. The development provided a fresh catalyst for traders, prompting a shift away from the safe-haven Swiss franc and back into the US dollar.

The agreement's announcement served as a crucial support level for the struggling pair, interrupting its recent bearish trend. While the broader market focus remains on broader risk sentiment, the deal offered a temporary reprieve for the USD, allowing it to claw back some of its recent losses against the CHF.

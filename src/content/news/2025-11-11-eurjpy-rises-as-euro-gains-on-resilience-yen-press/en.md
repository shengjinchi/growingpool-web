The EUR/JPY currency pair edged higher on Tuesday, trading near 178.30 as the Euro demonstrated resilience. The single currency found support from better-than-anticipated economic data out of Germany, which helped offset broader market uncertainty. This strength against the Japanese Yen pushed the exchange rate up approximately 0.10% for the session as trading continued.

The Yen remained under pressure due to the Bank of Japan's persistently dovish policy stance, creating a clear divergence with other major central banks. This dynamic continues to drive the pair's upward trajectory, with markets closely monitoring for any shift in the BoJ's rhetoric. The cross continues to attract attention from traders betting on further Euro strength against the beleaguered Yen.

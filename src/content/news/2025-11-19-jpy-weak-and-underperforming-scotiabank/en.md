The Japanese Yen continues to struggle, declining 0.4% against a broadly stronger US Dollar. According to Scotiabank's Chief FX Strategists Shaun Osborne and Eric Theoret, the currency is underperforming nearly all of its G10 peers in the current trading environment. This persistent weakness keeps the USD/JPY exchange rate elevated, reflecting the ongoing divergence in monetary policy between the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve.

The Yen's losses are primarily driven by a sustained environment of US Dollar strength, which is weighing on most major currency pairs. While the EUR and GBP are also down versus the USD, their losses are less pronounced than those of the JPY. This dynamic underscores the Yen's role as a key funding currency, which often leaves it vulnerable during periods of robust risk appetite and firming US Treasury yields, pushing the pair toward significant technical resistance levels.

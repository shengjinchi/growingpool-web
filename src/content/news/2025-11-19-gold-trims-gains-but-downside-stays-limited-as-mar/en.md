Gold pared earlier gains during Wednesday's trading session, pressured by a strengthening US Dollar. The XAU/USD pair retreated from an intraday peak near $4,132 to trade around $4,090. The dollar's resilience, fueled by anticipation of the upcoming Federal Reserve Meeting Minutes, created headwinds for the dollar-denominated commodity, curbing its upward momentum despite initial strength.

The precious metal's downside, however, remains cushioned as traders adopt a cautious stance ahead of the key Fed release. Investors are eagerly scrutinizing the minutes for fresh clues on the central bank's future interest rate path. This event risk is limiting more aggressive selling in gold, as the outlook for US monetary policy continues to be the primary driver for the currency pair's exchange rate.

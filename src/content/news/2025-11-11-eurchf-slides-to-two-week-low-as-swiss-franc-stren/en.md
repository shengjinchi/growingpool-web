The Euro fell to a two-week low against the Swiss Franc on Tuesday, with the EUR/CHF exchange rate sliding as the Swiss currency broadly strengthened. The pair traded under notable technical pressure, breaking through key support levels as selling momentum accelerated. This dynamic placed the Euro among the worst performers against its Swiss counterpart during the European trading session, highlighting a clear shift in market sentiment favoring the CHF.

The Swiss Franc's strength was fueled by growing optimism surrounding a potential trade deal between the United States and Switzerland. This development has improved the outlook for the Swiss economy, making the safe-haven currency more attractive to investors. The Franc's gains were not isolated to the Euro; it also registered notable advances against the US Dollar, indicating a broad-based rally driven by these positive fundamental developments.

For forex traders, the breach of significant technical supports for EUR/CHF suggests the potential for a deeper corrective move. The market's focus will now be on any official announcements from US or Swiss officials regarding the trade negotiations, which could dictate the next major directional move for the currency pair. This represents a significant shift from the Franc's typical safe-haven flows to ones driven by trade optimism.

Gold retreated on Thursday as bullish momentum faded, with XAU/USD easing toward the $4,200 level. The precious metal faced stiff resistance near $4,250, causing its earlier gains to unravel. This pullback reflects a struggle for direction as traders weigh broader market factors influencing the dollar-denominated asset.

The failure to hold above key technical levels suggests a potential consolidation phase for the trading pair. Market participants are closely monitoring the exchange rate for signs of a renewed push higher or a deeper correction. The USD's performance remains a critical driver for gold's near-term trajectory as it trades against the US dollar.

Gold traded choppily near $4,080 on Monday as the market digested hawkish Federal Reserve commentary. The XAU/USD pair found its upside potential capped by expectations that the central bank will maintain its current restrictive policy stance at the upcoming December meeting. This sentiment kept a lid on the non-yielding asset, limiting any significant bullish momentum.

Traders adopted a cautious stance ahead of a data-heavy week, with all eyes on the highly anticipated Non-Farm Payrolls report. This key employment data will be crucial for shaping future Fed policy expectations and, consequently, the direction of the US Dollar. The exchange rate for gold remains sensitive to these fundamental drivers, with its near-term trajectory heavily dependent on the incoming economic figures.

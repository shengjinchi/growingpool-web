The USD/JPY currency pair staged a significant recovery on Friday, rebounding toward nine-month highs as the US Dollar found its footing. After touching an intraday low near 153.62, the exchange rate climbed to trade around 154.60. This upward movement puts the pair on course to secure modest weekly gains, underscoring a period of sustained strength for the Greenback against the Japanese Yen.

The rebound was primarily fueled by a steadying US Dollar, which drew support from lingering expectations that the Federal Reserve will maintain a higher-for-longer interest rate stance. This dynamic continues to widen the monetary policy divergence with the Bank of Japan, keeping the Yen under pressure. Traders are closely monitoring these levels, as the pair's approach to multi-month peaks increases the potential for intervention from Japanese authorities.

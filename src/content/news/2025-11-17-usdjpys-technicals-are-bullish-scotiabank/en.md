The Japanese Yen weakened against the US Dollar on Thursday, with the USD/JPY exchange rate advancing as the currency proved to be a mid-performer within the G10 basket. Strategists at Scotiabank noted the pair’s bullish technical posture, contributing to a trading environment that favored the Greenback. The move underscored a broader theme of USD strength as markets continued to assess divergent monetary policy outlooks between the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan.

The currency pair’s 0.2% decline for the JPY reflects ongoing pressure from yield differentials, keeping the exchange rate elevated. This technical strength suggests potential for further gains in the near term, with traders monitoring key resistance levels. The dynamics continue to be driven by the stark contrast between a still-hawkish Fed and a decidedly dovish BoJ, a fundamental driver that has underpinned the pair’s sustained upward trend throughout the year.

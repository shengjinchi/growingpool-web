The Pound Sterling is trading with modest weakness against the US Dollar, edging approximately 0.1% lower for the session. Despite this slight dip versus the greenback, the GBP is demonstrating notable resilience across the broader market. Strategists at Scotiabank note the currency is posting a relatively strong performance against the majority of its G10 counterparts, indicating underlying strength.

This mixed performance suggests a divergence in currency dynamics, where the Pound is being supported on the crosses even as the USD maintains a firm footing. The exchange rate's ability to hold its ground against other major pairs points to sustained trader interest in the British currency. Market participants are likely weighing domestic economic data against broader global risk trends, with the GBP's trading range remaining a key focus for short-term direction.

The New Zealand Dollar surrendered its early gains against the US Dollar on Thursday, with the NZD/USD pair retreating as markets priced in a near-certain interest rate cut from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. This persistent dovish expectation continues to exert sustained pressure on the Kiwi, limiting any significant rallies and keeping sellers in control of the near-term momentum.

Meanwhile, the US Dollar held firm across the board, supported by its status as a preferred safe-haven asset amid ongoing global economic uncertainties. The strength in the USD contributed to the Kiwi's weakness, with the exchange rate testing key technical support levels. The broad-based Greenback also maintained its strength against major peers like the Euro, with the EUR/USD pair remaining contained within a familiar trading range.

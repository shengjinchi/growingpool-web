Gold prices retreated below the $4,100 level during Wednesday's American trading session as a resurgence in US Dollar demand pressured the XAU/USD pair. A wave of risk aversion swept across financial markets, strengthening the USD across the board. While the safe-haven appeal of gold provided some support, the pair moved off its daily peak of $4,132.

This environment limited the metal's downside movement even as the exchange rate faced selling pressure. The market's shift toward the USD underscores the prevailing cautious sentiment among forex traders.

The US Dollar extended its rally to fresh six-month highs on Thursday, maintaining its upward momentum. The currency's strength was primarily fueled by shifting expectations for Federal Reserve policy, as markets increasingly discount the likelihood of another interest rate cut in December. This repricing continues to drive robust demand for the greenback across the board.

The Dollar Index, which tracks the USD against a basket of major currencies, advanced further into positive territory. Key currency pairs felt the pressure, with EUR/USD trading heavily near multi-month lows. The market's focus now shifts to the upcoming release of PMI data, which could provide fresh catalysts for forex trading and either extend or challenge the current USD bullish trend.

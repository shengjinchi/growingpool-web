Silver retreated on Thursday, snapping a four-day winning streak as the resolution to a US government shutdown reduced immediate safe-haven demand. The XAG/USD pair traded around $53.00, marking a 0.35% daily decline. This pullback followed a significant rally that had taken the grey metal to an intraday peak of $54.39, bringing it within striking distance of its historic high at $54.86 reached earlier in the week.

The market's risk-on mood, fueled by the political agreement in Washington, lessened the appeal of traditional safe-haven assets like precious metals. Consequently, the US dollar found firmer footing, pressuring dollar-denominated silver. Traders are now assessing whether this is a brief consolidation or the start of a deeper correction, with many watching for a potential retest of the record high. The price action reflects a recalibration of short-term market sentiment.

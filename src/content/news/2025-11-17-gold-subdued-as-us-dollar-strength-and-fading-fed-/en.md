Gold began the week on a softer footing as a robust US Dollar and recalibrated expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts kept the precious metal under pressure. The XAU/USD pair is consolidating following a two-day decline, relinquishing some of the gains that had propelled it to a three-week high last week. This pullback reflects a shift in broader market sentiment.

The primary catalyst for the subdued trading is the Dollar's strength, which makes gold more expensive for holders of other currencies. Traders are increasingly reassessing the timeline for potential Fed easing, with higher-for-longer US interest rates diminishing the appeal of the non-yielding asset. This dynamic has created significant headwinds for the exchange rate, forcing it to retreat from its recent peaks.

Market participants are now closely monitoring key technical levels for the XAU/USD currency pair, seeking signals for its next directional move. The current consolidation suggests a period of equilibrium as the market digests the latest economic data and central bank commentary. The trajectory of the USD will likely remain the dominant factor influencing gold's near-term trading patterns.

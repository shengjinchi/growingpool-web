The British Pound advanced against a weakening US Dollar, pushing the GBP/USD exchange rate to a two-day high of 1.3197. The pair was up 0.46% as broad-based USD selling provided support. A key catalyst was the US government's reopening, which ended a shutdown and is set to unleash a flow of delayed economic data for forex traders and Federal Reserve officials to scrutinize.

This impending data deluge is causing markets to reevaluate the USD's near-term trajectory, with its weakness allowing rival currencies to gain ground. Concurrently, growing market speculation that the Bank of England may pivot towards interest rate cuts is applying its own pressure on the Sterling, capping its potential gains. The pair is now testing technical resistance near the 1.3200 handle.

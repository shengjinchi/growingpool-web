The US Dollar continues to dominate the Japanese Yen, with USD/JPY holding near nine-month highs during Monday's trading session. The exchange rate's sustained strength highlights the stark divergence in monetary policy between the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan, keeping the pair buoyed as the greenback finds broad support.

The Yen's weakness is primarily attributed to Japan's expansionary fiscal stance under Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, which is undermining the currency. This persistent pressure, combined with a robust USD, is driving the pair's bullish momentum as traders favor the higher-yielding dollar.

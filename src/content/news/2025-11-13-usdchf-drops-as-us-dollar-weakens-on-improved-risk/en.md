The US Dollar continues to weaken against the Swiss Franc, with the USD/CHF exchange rate dropping sharply to trade near 0.7910 during Thursday’s session. The currency pair has recorded a significant daily loss of 0.80%, extending a pronounced bearish trend. This latest move has driven the pair to a fresh three-week low, marking its seventh consecutive day of declines as selling pressure persists.

This sustained downturn is primarily fueled by a broad-based improvement in global risk appetite, which diminishes demand for the safe-haven US Dollar. As investors move capital into higher-yielding assets, the Greenback faces headwinds across the board. The Swiss Franc, often considered a safe-haven currency itself, is capitalizing on the USD's broad weakness and its own defensive characteristics in the current market environment.

The technical outlook for the pair has turned increasingly negative following this breakdown. The breach of key support levels suggests the potential for further losses in the near term. Traders will be closely monitoring the pair's ability to hold below the 0.7900 psychological handle, with a sustained break potentially opening the door for a deeper corrective move in the currency pair.

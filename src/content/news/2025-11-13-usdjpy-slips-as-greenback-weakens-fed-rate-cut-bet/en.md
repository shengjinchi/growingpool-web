The Japanese Yen strengthened against the US Dollar on Thursday, halting a four-day rally as the Greenback faced broad selling pressure. The USD/JPY pair retreated to trade near 154.35, slipping from the previous session's nine-month peak of 155.05. This pullback reflects a pause in the Dollar's recent momentum, with traders taking profits ahead of key economic data releases from the United States that could influence the Federal Reserve's policy trajectory.

The Dollar's weakness is largely attributed to shifting expectations for interest rate cuts. Market participants are now closely awaiting delayed US economic data to gauge the strength of the economy and the potential timing of Fed easing. This data-dependent stance has introduced uncertainty, causing the USD to relinquish some of its recent gains against major counterparts, including the Euro and the Yen.

The immediate focus for the currency pair remains on upcoming US figures. A stronger-than-expected data outcome could revive bets on a hawkish Fed, potentially providing fresh support for the USD/JPY exchange rate. Conversely, weak data may fuel further Dollar selling, allowing the Yen to extend its recovery as traders increase their expectations for an earlier Fed rate cut.

Gold retreated from a three-week high on Tuesday as sellers emerged near the $4,150 area, trimming its earlier gains. The XAU/USD pair is trading around $4,107 after failing to extend Monday's sharp advance. This pullback indicates potential resistance at that technical level, causing the metal to ease during the European trading session.

The earlier strength was driven by a combination of a softer US Dollar and shifting market sentiment. However, the rally lost momentum as investors took profits at the higher levels. The price action suggests the market is consolidating, with traders now watching for the next major catalyst to determine direction for the currency pair.
